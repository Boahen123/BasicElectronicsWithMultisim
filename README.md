MultiSim is a powerful circuit simulation tool for studying circuits in courses such as Basic Electronics, Logic Design and Circuit/Network Theory. This repository contains files designed with MultiSim under Basic Electronics.Examples of these simulations are Half and Full-wave rectification, Clipper and Clipping circuits amongst others.
